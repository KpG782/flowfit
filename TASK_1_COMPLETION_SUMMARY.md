# Task 1 Completion Summary

## Task: Set up core architecture and folder structure

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Clean Architecture Folder Structure

Successfully created a complete clean architecture directory structure following the design document specifications:

#### Core Layer
- `lib/core/domain/entities/` - Core business entities
- `lib/core/domain/repositories/` - Core repository interfaces
- `lib/core/data/repositories/` - Core repository implementations
- `lib/core/data/models/` - Data transfer objects
- `lib/core/providers/` - Riverpod providers (already existed, preserved)

#### Features Layer
Created complete feature modules for:
- **Fitness** - Workout tracking and heart rate monitoring
- **Nutrition** - Food logging and macro tracking
- **Sleep** - Sleep session tracking
- **Mood** - Mood logging and workout recommendations
- **Reports** - Analytics and visualizations
- **Profile** - User profile and settings

Each feature has the following structure:
```
features/{feature}/
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   └── repositories/
├── data/
│   └── repositories/
├── providers/
└── presentation/
    ├── screens/
    └── widgets/
```

#### Shared Layer
- `lib/shared/navigation/` - Routing configuration
- `lib/shared/theme/` - App theming
- `lib/shared/utils/` - Helper functions

### 2. Configured Riverpod Code Generation

- ✅ Created `build.yaml` with Riverpod generator configuration
- ✅ Created example provider demonstrating code generation
- ✅ Successfully ran `build_runner` and generated `.g.dart` files
- ✅ Verified code generation works correctly

### 3. Configured go_router Navigation

- ✅ Created `lib/shared/navigation/app_router.dart`
- ✅ Set up basic route structure with placeholder routes for:
  - Dashboard (/)
  - Fitness (/fitness)
  - Nutrition (/nutrition)
  - Sleep (/sleep)
  - Mood (/mood)
  - Reports (/reports)
  - Profile (/profile)
- ✅ Configured error handling for unknown routes

### 4. Verified Dependencies

All required dependencies are present in `pubspec.yaml`:
- ✅ `flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.9` - State management
- ✅ `riverpod_annotation: ^2.3.3` - Code generation annotations
- ✅ `go_router: ^13.0.0` - Navigation
- ✅ `build_runner: ^2.4.7` - Code generation tool
- ✅ `riverpod_generator: ^2.3.9` - Provider code generation
- ✅ `freezed: ^2.4.6` - Immutable models
- ✅ `json_serializable: ^6.7.1` - JSON serialization

### 5. Created Documentation

- ✅ `lib/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Comprehensive architecture documentation
- ✅ `lib/core/SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Setup completion checklist
- ✅ This summary document

## Requirements Satisfied

This task satisfies the following requirements from the specification:

- ✅ **Requirement 2.1**: Code organized in clean architecture layers
- ✅ **Requirement 2.2**: Domain layer with entities and repository interfaces
- ✅ **Requirement 2.3**: Data layer with repository implementations
- ✅ **Requirement 2.4**: Presentation layer with screens and widgets
- ✅ **Requirement 2.5**: Shared layer for cross-cutting concerns

## Files Created

### Configuration Files
- `build.yaml` - Build runner configuration

### Code Files
- `lib/shared/navigation/app_router.dart` - Router configuration
- `lib/core/providers/example_provider.dart` - Example provider
- `lib/core/providers/example_provider.g.dart` - Generated provider code (auto-generated)

### Documentation Files
- `lib/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture documentation
- `lib/core/SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - Setup completion document
- `TASK_1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Directory Structure Files
- 36 `.gitkeep` files to preserve empty directories in version control

## Verification Steps Completed

1. ✅ Ran `flutter pub get` - All dependencies installed successfully
2. ✅ Ran `flutter pub run build_runner build` - Code generation successful
3. ✅ Verified generated `.g.dart` file exists and is correct
4. ✅ Verified all directories were created with proper structure

## Next Steps

The core architecture is now ready for the next task:

**Task 2: Define domain entities and repository interfaces**

This will involve:
- Creating domain entities (UserProfile, Workout, FoodLog, etc.)
- Defining repository interfaces for each feature
- Setting up the foundation for mock data implementations

## Commands for Future Reference

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate provider code (one-time)
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Generate provider code (watch mode)
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Run tests
flutter test
```

## Notes

- The existing `lib/services/watch_bridge.dart` has been preserved and will be integrated with the new architecture
- Legacy code in `lib/models/`, `lib/screens/`, and `lib/widgets/` remains untouched and will be migrated gradually
- All new code follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns
- The architecture is backend-ready with clear integration points for Supabase

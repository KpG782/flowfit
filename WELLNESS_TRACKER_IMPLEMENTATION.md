## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Sensor Data Pipeline
```
Samsung Galaxy Watch Sensors
    ↓
WatchBridgeService (heartRateStream)
PhoneDataListener (sensorBatchStream)
    ↓
WellnessStateService
    ├─ Heart Rate Buffer (30 seconds)
    ├─ Accelerometer Buffer (10 seconds, 320 samples)
    ├─ Motion Magnitude Calculator
    └─ State Detection Engine
        ├─ STRESS: HR > 100 BPM AND motion < 0.5 m/s² for 30+ seconds
        ├─ CARDIO: HR > 100 BPM AND motion > 2.0 m/s² (immediate)
        └─ CALM: HR < 90 BPM (immediate)
    ↓
WellnessStateNotifier (Riverpod)
    ↓
WellnessTrackerPage UI
```

### State Detection Rules
- **STRESS**: High heart rate (>100 BPM) + Low motion (<0.5 m/s²) for 30+ seconds
- **CARDIO**: High heart rate (>100 BPM) + High motion (>2.0 m/s²) - immediate
- **CALM**: Low heart rate (<90 BPM) - immediate

### Hysteresis Filtering
- CALM → STRESS: 30 seconds delay
- CARDIO → STRESS: 5 minutes delay
- CARDIO → CALM: 2 minutes delay
- STRESS → CALM: 1 minute delay

7. `lib/widgets/wellness/wellness_map_widget.dart` - Interactive map with routes
8. `lib/widgets/wellness/wellness_stats_card.dart` - Daily statistics display

### Files Modified
1. `lib/main.dart` - Added route `/wellness-tracker` and SharedPreferences initialization
2. `lib/screens/home/widgets/cta_section.dart` - Added "Wellness Tracker" button
3. `lib/services/openroute_service.dart` - Added POI search method

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Navigate to Wellness Tracker**:
   - Open app → Track Tab → Click "Wellness Tracker" button

2. **Sensor Connection**:
   - Ensure Samsung Galaxy Watch is paired and connected
   - Grant body sensor permissions when prompted

3. **State Detection**:
   - Watch will automatically detect CALM/STRESS/CARDIO states
   - State changes trigger UI updates and alerts

4. **Stress Response**:
   - When STRESS is detected, banner appears with route suggestions
   - Click "Show Routes" to view calming walking routes on map
   - Select a route to see details (distance, duration, green space %)

5. **Exercise Detection**:
   - When CARDIO is detected, banner appears with workout options
   - Click Run/Walk/Cycle to start tracking workout

## 🔍 Integration with Existing Systems

### TensorFlow Lite Activity Classifier
- The wellness tracker uses the same sensor data pipeline as the AI activity classifier
- `PhoneDataListener.sensorBatchStream` provides 4-feature vectors [accX, accY, accZ, bpm]
- This data can be fed to the TFLite model for activity classification
- Future enhancement: Use AI predictions to improve state detection accuracy

### Workout Flow
- Cardio detection seamlessly integrates with existing workout tracking
- Passes activity type and start time to workout session
- Maintains data continuity between wellness monitoring and workout tracking

### Supabase Integration
- Wellness state history can be synced to Supabase for cloud backup
- User preferences and settings stored in user profile
- Future enhancement: Cross-device sync and historical analysis

## ✨ Design Highlights

- **GeneralSans Font**: Consistent typography throughout
- **48x48 dp Touch Targets**: Accessibility compliant
- **16px Border Radius**: Consistent card design
- **White Surface on #F1F6FD Background**: Clean, modern aesthetic
- **Smooth Animations**: Slide-down banners, pulsing location marker
- **Color-Coded States**: Green (Calm), Orange (Cardio), Red (Stress)

## 🎉 Ready for Testing!

The wellness tracker is now fully functional and integrated with the existing sensor infrastructure. All biometric data flows from the Samsung Galaxy Watch through the established WatchBridgeService and PhoneDataListener, ensuring compatibility with the TensorFlow Lite activity classifier and other features.

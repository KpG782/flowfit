# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the integration of advanced sensor capabilities into Pulsify to enhance activity detection, environmental awareness, and watch face integration. The system will leverage WearOS Sensors library for comprehensive activity tracking, Android SensorManager for environmental sensors (barometer, light), and Complications API for seamless watch face integration on Galaxy Watch 6.

## Glossary

- **Pulsify**: The health and fitness tracking application for Galaxy Watch 6 and companion phone
- **WearOS Sensors Library**: Third-party library providing unified access to IMU sensors, GPS, and concurrent sensor data collection
- **SensorManager**: Android's native sensor framework for accessing device hardware sensors
- **Complications API**: WearOS API that allows apps to display data on watch faces
- **IMU**: Inertial Measurement Unit - combination of accelerometer and gyroscope sensors
- **Barometer**: Pressure sensor used for altitude and elevation tracking
- **Ambient Light Sensor**: Sensor that detects environmental light levels
- **Activity Detection**: Process of identifying user movement patterns and activity types
- **Background Collection**: Continuous sensor data gathering while app is not in foreground
- **Watch-to-Phone Sync**: Data transmission mechanism from watch to companion phone app

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a fitness enthusiast, I want Pulsify to automatically detect my activity type and intensity, so that I can get accurate tracking without manually starting workouts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user performs physical activity THEN the system SHALL collect accelerometer data at 100ms intervals
2. WHEN the user performs physical activity THEN the system SHALL collect gyroscope data at 100ms intervals
3. WHEN accelerometer and gyroscope data are collected THEN the system SHALL classify activity type based on movement patterns
4. WHEN activity intensity changes THEN the system SHALL update the classification within 2 seconds
5. WHERE the user enables background tracking THEN the system SHALL continue collecting IMU sensor data when the app is not in foreground

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a hiker and outdoor enthusiast, I want Pulsify to track my elevation changes and GPS location during activities, so that I can analyze my route and altitude gains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts an outdoor activity THEN the system SHALL collect GPS coordinates at 5-second intervals
2. WHEN the user moves vertically THEN the system SHALL collect barometer pressure readings at 1-second intervals
3. WHEN barometer data is collected THEN the system SHALL calculate altitude changes from pressure readings
4. WHEN GPS data is collected THEN the system SHALL calculate distance traveled and current speed
5. WHEN location accuracy is below 20 meters THEN the system SHALL use GPS data for route tracking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user concerned about battery life, I want Pulsify to optimize sensor usage based on ambient conditions, so that my watch battery lasts throughout the day.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ambient light level changes THEN the system SHALL detect the change within 1 second
2. WHEN ambient light is below 10 lux THEN the system SHALL reduce screen brightness to minimum
3. WHEN the watch is stationary for 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL reduce accelerometer sampling rate to 1Hz
4. WHEN significant motion is detected THEN the system SHALL restore normal sampling rates within 500ms
5. WHEN battery level is below 15% THEN the system SHALL disable GPS tracking and reduce sensor sampling rates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a watch face enthusiast, I want to see my current heart rate and activity data on any watch face, so that I can monitor my health at a glance without opening the app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a watch face requests heart rate data THEN the system SHALL provide current heart rate value within 1 second
2. WHEN a watch face requests step count THEN the system SHALL provide current daily step count
3. WHEN a watch face requests activity status THEN the system SHALL provide current activity type and intensity
4. WHEN sensor data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback message indicating data is loading
5. WHEN complication data updates THEN the system SHALL refresh watch face display within 2 seconds

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data-driven athlete, I want all sensor data synchronized to my phone and cloud storage, so that I can analyze detailed metrics and track long-term trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensor data is collected on the watch THEN the system SHALL buffer data locally until sync is available
2. WHEN the watch connects to the phone THEN the system SHALL transmit buffered sensor data within 30 seconds
3. WHEN data transmission fails THEN the system SHALL retry transmission with exponential backoff up to 5 attempts
4. WHEN data is successfully transmitted THEN the system SHALL clear the local buffer to free storage
5. WHEN local storage exceeds 80% capacity THEN the system SHALL delete oldest sensor data first

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to grant or deny permissions for different sensors, so that I have control over what data Pulsify can access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app first launches THEN the system SHALL request permissions for location, body sensors, and activity recognition
2. WHEN the user denies a sensor permission THEN the system SHALL disable features requiring that sensor
3. WHEN the user grants a previously denied permission THEN the system SHALL enable corresponding features within 5 seconds
4. WHEN sensor permissions are checked THEN the system SHALL display current permission status in settings
5. IF a required permission is denied THEN the system SHALL provide clear explanation of which features are unavailable

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining Pulsify, I want comprehensive error handling for sensor failures, so that the app remains stable when sensors malfunction or become unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sensor fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL log the error with sensor type and error code
2. WHEN a sensor becomes unavailable during operation THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality
3. WHEN sensor data contains invalid values THEN the system SHALL filter out invalid readings
4. WHEN multiple sensor errors occur THEN the system SHALL notify the user once with aggregated error information
5. WHEN a sensor recovers from error state THEN the system SHALL automatically resume data collection

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user tracking multiple activities, I want sensor data to be accurately timestamped and synchronized, so that I can correlate different metrics in my analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensor data is collected THEN the system SHALL timestamp each reading with millisecond precision
2. WHEN data from multiple sensors is combined THEN the system SHALL align timestamps to a common reference
3. WHEN the watch clock is adjusted THEN the system SHALL maintain relative timing of sensor events
4. WHEN data is transmitted to the phone THEN the system SHALL preserve original timestamps
5. WHEN displaying historical data THEN the system SHALL convert timestamps to user's local timezone

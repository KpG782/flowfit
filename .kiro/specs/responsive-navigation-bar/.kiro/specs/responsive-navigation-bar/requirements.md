# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the navigation bar overflow issue on devices with system navigation bars (gesture bars, software buttons). The current implementation uses a fixed height container that doesn't account for system UI insets, causing the navigation bar to overlap with device navigation controls on phones like the Xiaomi 14T. The solution will make the navigation bar responsive to all screen sizes and system UI configurations.

## Glossary

- **Navigation Bar**: The bottom navigation component in the Pulsify app that provides access to Home, Health, Track, Progress, and Profile tabs
- **System UI Insets**: The safe area padding required to avoid overlapping with system navigation bars, gesture indicators, or notches
- **MediaQuery**: Flutter's mechanism for accessing device screen information and safe area insets
- **SafeArea**: Flutter widget that automatically applies padding to avoid system UI intrusions

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile app user with gesture navigation or software buttons, I want the navigation bar to respect my device's system UI, so that I can access all navigation items without them being obscured by my phone's navigation controls

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app renders on any device, THE Navigation Bar SHALL apply bottom padding equal to the system's bottom inset value
2. WHEN the device has no system navigation bar, THE Navigation Bar SHALL display with standard padding only
3. WHEN the device orientation changes, THE Navigation Bar SHALL recalculate and apply appropriate padding
4. THE Navigation Bar SHALL maintain a minimum touch target size of 48x48 pixels for all navigation items
5. THE Navigation Bar SHALL remain visually consistent across all supported Android devices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the navigation bar implementation to use Flutter's responsive design patterns, so that the component automatically adapts to different device configurations without manual intervention

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Navigation Bar SHALL use MediaQuery to retrieve device-specific padding values
2. THE Navigation Bar SHALL use SafeArea widget or equivalent padding calculations to handle system UI insets
3. THE Navigation Bar SHALL remove fixed height constraints that prevent responsive behavior
4. THE Navigation Bar SHALL calculate its height dynamically based on content and system insets
5. THE Navigation Bar SHALL maintain proper spacing between navigation items regardless of screen size

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to verify the navigation bar works correctly on various devices, so that I can ensure consistent user experience across the product line

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tested on devices with gesture navigation, THE Navigation Bar SHALL not overlap with the gesture indicator
2. WHEN tested on devices with software buttons, THE Navigation Bar SHALL not overlap with the button bar
3. WHEN tested on devices with no system navigation, THE Navigation Bar SHALL display without excessive bottom padding
4. THE Navigation Bar SHALL maintain consistent icon sizes and label positioning across all test devices
5. THE Navigation Bar SHALL preserve all existing functionality including tab switching and visual feedback

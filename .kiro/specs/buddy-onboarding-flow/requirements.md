## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for transforming the FlowFit onboarding experience into a kid-friendly, gamified flow centered around "Buddy" - a customizable companion pet. The new onboarding flow will introduce children (ages 7-12) to their fitness companion through an engaging "egg hatching" metaphor, allow them to choose their Buddy's starting color, name their companion, and complete a quick profile setup. The system maintains the existing FlowFit brand identity (blue-centered color palette) while creating an engaging, gender-neutral experience inspired by successful self-care apps that motivates children to develop healthy habits.

# Core Architecture Setup Complete ✅

This document confirms that the core architecture and folder structure for FlowFit has been successfully set up.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Folder Structure Created

The following clean architecture directory structure has been established:

```
lib/
├── core/
│   ├── domain/
│   │   ├── entities/        ✅ Created
│   │   └── repositories/    ✅ Created
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── repositories/    ✅ Created
│   │   └── models/          ✅ Created
│   └── providers/           ✅ Already existed
│       ├── repositories/
│       ├── services/
│       └── state/
│
├── features/
│   ├── fitness/             ✅ Created
│   │   ├── domain/entities/
│   │   ├── domain/repositories/
│   │   ├── data/repositories/
│   │   ├── providers/
│   │   └── presentation/screens/

│
└── shared/
    ├── navigation/          ✅ Created
    ├── theme/               ✅ Created
    └── utils/               ✅ Created
```

### 2. Dependencies Verified

All required dependencies are present in `pubspec.yaml`:

- ✅ `flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.9` - State management
- ✅ `riverpod_annotation: ^2.3.3` - Code generation annotations
- ✅ `go_router: ^13.0.0` - Navigation
- ✅ `build_runner: ^2.4.7` - Code generation tool
- ✅ `riverpod_generator: ^2.3.9` - Provider code generation
- ✅ `freezed: ^2.4.6` - Immutable models
- ✅ `json_serializable: ^6.7.1` - JSON serialization

### 3. Riverpod Code Generation Configured

- ✅ Created `build.yaml` with Riverpod generator configuration
- ✅ Created example provider in `lib/core/providers/example_provider.dart`
- ✅ Successfully ran `build_runner` and generated `.g.dart` files
- ✅ Verified code generation is working correctly

### 4. Navigation Configured

- ✅ Created `lib/shared/navigation/app_router.dart`
- ✅ Set up basic route structure with go_router
- ✅ Defined placeholder routes for all main features:
  - Dashboard (/)
  - Fitness (/fitness)
  - Nutrition (/nutrition)
  - Sleep (/sleep)
  - Mood (/mood)
  - Reports (/reports)
  - Profile (/profile)

### 5. Documentation Created

- ✅ Created `lib/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Comprehensive architecture documentation
- ✅ Created this setup completion document

## Next Steps

The core architecture is now ready for feature implementation. The next tasks will:

1. Define domain entities and repository interfaces
2. Implement mock repositories with sample data
3. Set up Riverpod providers for state management
4. Build UI screens and components

## Code Generation Commands

To generate Riverpod provider code:

```bash
# One-time generation
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Watch mode (auto-regenerate on file changes)
flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Verification

Run the following to verify the setup:

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate provider code
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Run tests (when available)
flutter test
```

## Architecture Principles

This setup follows clean architecture principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Domain, Data, and Presentation layers
2. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies point inward (Presentation → Domain ← Data)
3. **Interface Segregation**: Repository interfaces in domain, implementations in data
4. **Dependency Injection**: Riverpod providers manage all dependencies
5. **Backend-Ready**: Mock implementations can be easily swapped with real backend

## Requirements Satisfied

This task satisfies the following requirements from the spec:

- ✅ **Requirement 2.1**: Code organized in clean architecture layers
- ✅ **Requirement 2.2**: Domain layer with entities and repository interfaces
- ✅ **Requirement 2.3**: Data layer with repository implementations
- ✅ **Requirement 2.4**: Presentation layer with screens and widgets
- ✅ **Requirement 2.5**: Shared layer for cross-cutting concerns

**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Date**: Setup completed successfully
**Next Task**: Define domain entities and repository interfaces

# Wellness Feature — Mission Engine (Geofence)

This feature provides a unified geofence-based mission engine for wellness-focused features in FlowFit. It supports three primary mission types:

- Target (Fitness): Accumulate distance as users move away from a starting point; reach a target distance to complete the mission.
- Sanctuary (Mental): Reach a specific coordinate to trigger a mission "success" or journaling flow.
- Safety Net (Elderly): Alerts if the user steps outside a specified safety radius.

Core components:

- `GeofenceMission` (domain model) — mission metadata and runtime state
 - `GeofenceRepository` (data interface) — abstracts storage for missions
 - `InMemoryGeofenceRepository` — in-memory, demo-only storage (default)
- `GeofenceService` — listens to device location, handles events, tracks progress, and emits `GeofenceEvent`s (entered, exited, targetReached, outsideAlert)
- `WellnessMapsPage` — `flutter_map` (OpenStreetMap) widget for creating, editing, and managing missions; shows markers and geofence circles

How to use

1. This feature uses `flutter_map` (OpenStreetMap tiles) by default; no API key setup is required. See the project's README for details if you switch to other map providers.
2. Add the page via router: `GoRoute(path: '/wellness', builder: (ctx, state) => MapsPageWrapper())`
3. For persistent storage, replace the in-memory repository with your own persisted implementation (local DB or cloud) when wiring `MapsPageWrapper` into the app.

Notes & Next Steps

- Background geofencing requires native implementations on Android/iOS.
 - Replace `InMemoryGeofenceRepository` in production with a persisted implementation backed by a local DB or your cloud backend (e.g., Supabase) if persistence is needed.
- Add UI for editing existing Missions.
- Add local notifications to alert the user for safety net events or mission completions.
Wellness Mission Engine (Geofence)

Overview:
- This feature provides a single maps-based mission engine concentrating on geofencing logic.
- Goals:
  - Centralize geofence-driven experiences (fitness/mental health/safety) in one place.

Mission types:
- Target (Fitness): Track cumulative distance traveled while active. When `targetDistanceMeters` is reached, mission completes.
- Sanctuary (Mental Health): Represents a place users should reach. Entering the radius marks active success.
- Safety Net (Elderly/Emergency): If a user leaves the radius, the system raises an "outside" alert.

Files:
- `domain/geofence_mission.dart` — Model definitions (MissionType, GeofenceMission, LatLngSimple).
- `data/geofence_repository.dart` — In-memory repository for creative iteration and local testing.
- `services/geofence_service.dart` — Runs `geolocator` streams, detects enter/exit/alerts and emits events.
- `presentation/maps_page.dart` — Map UI with mission listing, creation by long-press, and basic interactions.
- `presentation/maps_page_wrapper.dart` — Helper wrapper that wires repository and service as `Provider` instances.

Integration:
- Add `MapsPageWrapper()` to your route (an example `/wellness` route is present in `lib/shared/navigation/app_router.dart`).
 - This feature uses `flutter_map` and OpenStreetMap tiles; if you switch to `google_maps_flutter`, follow the plugin docs for API key setup.
- Replace `InMemoryGeofenceRepository` with a persisted implementation backed by local DB or Supabase if persistence is needed.

Notes:
- This implementation is foreground-only; background geofencing requires platform-specific work and is out-of-scope for this initial iteration.
 - Provided to be an accessible starting point for the Mission Engine described in the feature request.

Native Geofence Plugin (`native_geofence`)
-----------------------------------------
We use the `native_geofence` plugin to support background geofence events and persistent geofence registration.

Quick setup
1. Add the package and run `flutter pub get` — it's included in `pubspec.yaml` as `native_geofence: ^1.2.0`.
2. Android: Ensure `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` are declared and follow Android 12+ background location guidelines.
3. iOS: Ensure the relevant `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` is declared if you plan to handle geofence events when the app is terminated.

Usage example (plugin pattern):

```dart
// Initialize the plugin first
await NativeGeofenceManager.instance.initialize();

// Example geofence
final zone1 = Geofence(
  id: 'zone1',
  location: Location(latitude: 40.75798, longitude: -73.98554),
  radiusMeters: 500,
  triggers: {GeofenceEvent.enter, GeofenceEvent.exit, GeofenceEvent.dwell},
);

// Dart top-level callback must be an @pragma('vm:entry-point') function
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
Future<void> geofenceTriggered(dynamic params) async {
  debugPrint('Geofence triggered with params: $params');
}

// Register the geofence with the plugin
await NativeGeofenceManager.instance.createGeofence(zone1, geofenceTriggered);
```

Notes:
- Background / terminated event behavior requires correct OS permissions and configuration.
- Keep your callback minimal; promote to a foreground service for heavy work (Android only).

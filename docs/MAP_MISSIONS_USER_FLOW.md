## Integration with Activity Tracker

### Why the Map Button is in Tracker:

1. **Context**: User is already thinking about activity/exercise
2. **Flow**: Natural progression from monitoring → planning → executing
3. **Data Connection**: Activity data + location data = complete picture

### Suggested Workflow:

```
Morning Routine:
1. Check Activity Tracker (see yesterday's stats)
2. Open Map Missions
3. Activate "Morning Walk" mission
4. Go for walk
5. Return to Activity Tracker to see results
```

## Permissions Required

### Location Permissions:
- **When In Use**: Required for map display and mission creation
- **Always/Background**: Required for mission tracking when app is closed

### Permission Flow:
1. First map open → Request "When In Use"
2. First mission activation → Request "Always" (if not granted)
3. User can manage in Settings

### Android Specific:
- Android 10+: Background location requires separate permission
- Android 12+: Approximate vs Precise location options

### iOS Specific:
- "Allow While Using App" vs "Allow Always"
- User can change in Settings → Privacy → Location

## Tips for Best Experience

### For Users:
1. **Start Simple**: Create one Target mission first
2. **Test Locally**: Walk around your block to test
3. **Adjust Radius**: If missions trigger too early/late, adjust radius
4. **Use Focus Mode**: For active missions, use Focus & Navigate
5. **Check Notifications**: Enable notifications for mission alerts

### For Caregivers (Safety Net):
1. Set up Safety Net mission on user's device
2. Test by walking to edge of zone
3. Verify you receive alerts
4. Adjust radius based on needs
5. Check battery usage (should be minimal)

## Troubleshooting

### Map not loading?
- Check internet connection (needs to download map tiles)
- Verify location permissions granted
- Try tapping the center location button

### Mission not triggering?
- Ensure mission is activated (green indicator)
- Check radius isn't too small
- Verify background location permission granted
- Check battery saver isn't blocking location

### Distance not tracking?
- For Target missions, ensure you're moving away from center
- Check GPS signal (works better outdoors)
- Verify mission is active

### Battery draining?
- Missions use native geofencing (efficient)
- Deactivate missions when not needed
- Reduce number of active missions
- Check other apps using location

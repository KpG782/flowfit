## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Sensor Data Flow
```
Samsung Galaxy Watch
    ↓
[WatchBridgeService] → heartRateStream (HeartRateData)
[PhoneDataListener] → sensorBatchStream (SensorBatch)
    ↓
[WellnessStateService]
    ├─ Heart Rate Buffer (30 seconds)
    ├─ Accelerometer Buffer (10 seconds, 320 samples)
    ├─ Motion Magnitude Calculator: sqrt(x² + y² + z²)
    └─ State Detection Engine
        ├─ STRESS: HR > 100 BPM AND motion < 0.5 m/s² for 30+ seconds
        ├─ CARDIO: HR > 100 BPM AND motion > 2.0 m/s² (immediate)
        └─ CALM: HR < 90 BPM (immediate)
    ↓
[WellnessStateNotifier] (Riverpod)
    ├─ State History (24 hours)
    ├─ State Transitions
    └─ Daily Statistics
    ↓
[WellnessTrackerPage] UI
    ├─ State Card
    ├─ Map Widget
    ├─ Stats Card
    ├─ Alert Banners
    └─ Debug Panel (debug mode only)
```

### State Detection Rules

**STRESS Detection:**
- Heart Rate: > 100 BPM
- Motion: < 0.5 m/s²
- Duration: 30+ seconds (hysteresis)
- Response: Show calming route suggestions

**CARDIO Detection:**
- Heart Rate: > 100 BPM
- Motion: > 2.0 m/s²
- Duration: Immediate
- Response: Offer workout tracking

**CALM Detection:**
- Heart Rate: < 90 BPM
- Duration: Immediate
- Response: Normal monitoring

### Hysteresis Filtering (Prevents Flickering)
- CALM → STRESS: 30 seconds delay
- CARDIO → STRESS: 5 minutes delay
- CARDIO → CALM: 2 minutes delay
- STRESS → CALM: 1 minute delay
- Priority: CARDIO > STRESS > CALM

- Test scenario shortcuts
- Performance metrics

To use debug panel:
1. Run app in debug mode
2. Navigate to wellness tracker
3. Tap purple bug icon (bottom right)
4. Use controls to test different scenarios

### State Persistence
Wellness data is persisted using SharedPreferences:
- `wellness_history` - Last 24 hours of state data
- `wellness_transitions` - State transition log
- `wellness_monitoring_enabled` - User preference
- `wellness_onboarding_complete` - Onboarding flag

### Performance Optimization
- Circular buffers for efficient memory usage
- Debounced UI updates (max 1 per second)
- Lazy loading for history data
- Aggressive map tile caching
- Reduced sampling rate in background

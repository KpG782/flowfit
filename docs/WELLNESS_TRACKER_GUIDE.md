## FAQ

**Q: How often does the app check my wellness state?**  
A: Continuously, with state updates every 1-2 seconds.

**Q: Will this drain my watch battery?**  
A: Battery impact is minimal (< 5% per hour). The app uses efficient buffering.

**Q: Can I use this without a Samsung Galaxy Watch?**  
A: Currently, a Samsung Galaxy Watch is required for heart rate monitoring.

**Q: Is my data shared with anyone?**  
A: No. All data is processed on your device only. Nothing is sent to external servers.

**Q: Can I export my wellness data?**  
A: Currently, data is stored locally. Cloud sync is planned for future updates.

**Q: How accurate is stress detection?**  
A: The algorithm uses validated thresholds (HR > 100 BPM + low motion). Accuracy improves over time as you use the feature.

**Q: Why do I need to wait 30 seconds for stress detection?**  
A: This prevents false positives. Brief heart rate spikes (like standing up) won't trigger alerts.

**Q: Can I customize the heart rate thresholds?**  
A: Currently, thresholds are fixed based on research. Custom thresholds may be added in future updates.

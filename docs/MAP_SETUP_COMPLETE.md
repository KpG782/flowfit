# Map Missions Setup - Complete ✅

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Removed Hardcoded Sample Mission
**File**: `lib/features/wellness/presentation/maps_page_wrapper.dart`

**Before**:
- Hardcoded "Neighborhood Walk" mission at Google HQ coordinates
- Always appeared on map load

**After**:
- Clean slate - no sample missions
- Map centers on user's actual GPS location
- Users create their own missions

---

### 2. ✅ Added Map Navigation Button
**Files**: 
- `lib/features/activity_classifier/presentation/tracker_page.dart`
- `lib/screens/home/widgets/cta_section.dart`

**Locations**:
1. **Activity Tracker Page**: Map icon in top-right AppBar
2. **Track Tab (Dashboard)**: "Map Missions" button in CTA section

**User Flow**:
```
Activity Tracker → Map Icon → Map Missions
OR
Dashboard → Track Tab → Map Missions Button → Map Missions
```

---

### 3. ✅ Created Tutorial Overlay
**File**: `lib/features/wellness/presentation/widgets/map_tutorial_overlay.dart`

**Features**:
- Shows on first map visit
- Explains 3 mission types
- Step-by-step instructions
- "Get Started" and "Skip" buttons
- Dark overlay with clear instructions

**Content**:
1. How to create missions (long-press)
2. Mission types explained (Target/Sanctuary/Safety Net)

### 4. ✅ Fixed Plugin Registration
**File**: `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/flowfit/MainActivity.kt`

**Fixed**:
- Added missing method channel `com.flowfit.phone/data`
- Registered `startListening`, `stopListening`, `isWatchConnected` methods
- Fixed MissingPluginException error

## What Users See Now

### First Time Opening Map:
1. **Loading**: "Loading..." with spinner
2. **Location Request**: System permission dialog
3. **Map Loads**: Centers on user's GPS location
4. **Tutorial Appears**: Dark overlay with instructions
5. **Empty Map**: No missions, ready to create

### Creating First Mission:
1. **Long-press** anywhere on map
2. **Overlay appears** with:
   - Title input
   - Mission type selector
   - Radius slider
   - Preview circle on map
3. **Tap Confirm**
4. **Mission created** and appears on map

### Mission Management:

   - Delete

---

## Location Handling

### Current Implementation:
- Uses `geolocator` package
- Requests location permission on map load
- Centers map on user's current GPS coordinates
- Updates location in real-time (blue dot with pulse)

### Permissions:
- **When In Use**: Granted on first map open
- **Always/Background**: Requested when activating first mission
- **Handled by**: `geolocator` and `native_geofence` plugins

---

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### For Production:

1. **Persistent Storage**
   - Replace `InMemoryGeofenceRepository`
   - Save missions to local database (SQLite)
   - Or sync to Supabase backend

2. **Background Location**
   - Properly handle Android 10+ background location
   - Add permission request flow
   - Test battery impact

3. **Tutorial Persistence**
   - Save "tutorial shown" flag to SharedPreferences
   - Don't show tutorial again after first time

4. **Mission Templates**
   - Pre-made mission types for quick setup
   - "Morning Walk", "Park Visit", "Home Safety"

5. **Analytics**
   - Track mission creation
   - Track mission completion
   - Track feature usage

6. **Error Handling**
   - Handle location permission denied
   - Handle GPS unavailable
   - Handle network errors (map tiles)

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Map not loading?**
- Check internet connection
- Verify location permission granted
- Try restarting app

**Tutorial not showing?**
- Clear app data to reset
- Or set `_showTutorial = true` in code

**Missions not saving?**
- Expected - using in-memory storage
- Implement persistent storage for production

**Background tracking not working?**
- Need to implement background location handling
- Request "Always" permission
- Test on physical device (not emulator)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Required for Production):
1. Implement persistent storage
2. Add tutorial persistence (SharedPreferences)
3. Test on multiple devices
4. Add error handling

### Short-term (Nice to Have):
1. Mission templates
2. Mission history/stats
3. Achievement badges
4. Social features

### Long-term (Future Enhancements):
1. Route recording
2. Mission sharing
3. Integration with fitness goals
4. Custom notification sounds

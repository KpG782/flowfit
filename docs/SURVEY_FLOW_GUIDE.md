## 📊 Data Flow

### Survey State Management (Recommended)

```dart
class SurveyState extends ChangeNotifier {
  // Screen 1: Basic Info
  String? firstName;
  DateTime? dateOfBirth;
  String? biologicalSex;
  
  // Screen 2: Body Measurements
  double? heightCm;
  double? weightKg;
  String unitSystem = 'metric';
  
  // Screen 3: Activity & Goals
  String? activityLevel;
  String? fitnessGoal;
  
  // Screen 4: Daily Targets
  int? targetCaloriesDaily;
  int targetStepsDaily = 10000;
  int targetActiveMinutesDaily = 30;
  double targetWaterLitersDaily = 2.0;
  
  // Calculated fields
  int? get age { /* ... */ }
  double? get bmi { /* ... */ }
  int? get bmr { /* ... */ }
  int? get tdee { /* ... */ }
}
```

### Calculation Formulas

**BMI**:
```dart
bmi = weight_kg / (height_m * height_m)
```

**BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)**:
```dart
// Mifflin-St Jeor Equation
BMR_male = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) + 5
BMR_female = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) - 161
```

**TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)**:
```dart
TDEE = BMR × activity_multiplier
// Sedentary: 1.2
// Moderate: 1.55
// Very Active: 1.725
```

**Target Calories**:
```dart
Target = TDEE + goal_adjustment
// Lose weight: -500
// Maintain: 0
// Build muscle: +300
// Improve cardio: 0
```

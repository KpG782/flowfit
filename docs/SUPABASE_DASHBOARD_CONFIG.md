# Supabase Dashboard Configuration for FlowFit

Quick reference for configuring your Supabase project for mobile deep linking.

## 1. URL Configuration

**Dashboard URL**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dnasghxxqwibwqnljvxr/auth/url-configuration

### Site URL
Set this to your primary deep link:
```
com.example.flowfit://auth-callback
```

### Redirect URLs
Add these URLs (one per line):
```
com.example.flowfit://auth-callback
com.example.flowfit.dev://auth-callback
http://localhost:3000/**
```

**Note**: The `**` wildcard allows any path under localhost for web testing.

## 2. Email Templates

**Dashboard URL**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dnasghxxqwibwqnljvxr/auth/templates

### Confirm Signup Template

Update the confirmation link to use the redirect URL:

**Subject**: `Confirm Your FlowFit Account`

**Body (HTML)**:
```html
<h2>Welcome to FlowFit!</h2>

<p>Thanks for signing up. Please confirm your email address by clicking the link below:</p>

<p>
  <a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}" style="display: inline-block; padding: 12px 24px; background-color: #2563EB; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 6px;">
    Confirm Email Address
  </a>
</p>

<p>Or copy and paste this URL into your browser:</p>
<p>{{ .ConfirmationURL }}</p>

<p>This link will expire in 24 hours.</p>

<p>If you didn't create an account with FlowFit, you can safely ignore this email.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br>The FlowFit Team</p>
```

**Body (Plain Text)**:

## 4. Testing Configuration

### For Development

While testing, you can temporarily:

1. **Disable Email Confirmation** (Auth Settings)
   - This allows immediate login without email verification
   - Remember to re-enable for production!

2. **Add Test Redirect URLs**
   ```
   com.example.flowfit.dev://auth-callback
   http://localhost:3000/**
   ```

3. **Use Test Email Services**
   - Consider using [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) or similar for testing
   - Or use your real email for testing

### For Production

1. **Enable Email Confirmation**: ON
2. **Remove development redirect URLs**
3. **Update Site URL** to production deep link
4. **Test with real email addresses**
5. **Monitor Auth logs** for issues

## 5. Monitoring & Debugging

### View Auth Logs

**Dashboard URL**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dnasghxxqwibwqnljvxr/logs/explorer

Filter for auth events:
```sql
SELECT * FROM auth.audit_log_entries 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 100;
```

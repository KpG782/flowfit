# Watch UI Redesign - Before & After

## The Problem
- Watch UI was cluttered with too many options
- Connection between watch and phone was unreliable
- Error messages were unclear
- Design didn't follow Wear OS best practices

## The Solution

### 1. Simplified Dashboard
**Removed:** 6-item scrollable menu with Activity, Steps, Workout, Sleep, Nutrition
**Added:** Single large "Heart Rate" button - clean and focused

### 2. Cleaner Heart Rate Screen
**Before:**
- Small icons and text
- Multiple status indicators
- Cluttered button layout
- IBI info taking space

**After:**
- Huge 56pt BPM display
- Single status dot
- Large START/STOP button
- SEND button only when needed

### 3. Better Connection
**Improvements:**
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Tries all connected devices
- Clear error messages
- Automatic retry logic

## Quick Test

```bash
# 1. Deploy phone app
cd scripts
test-phone.bat

# 2. Deploy watch app (new terminal)
test-watch.bat

# 3. Test on watch
- Tap "Heart Rate"
- Tap "START"
- Wait for reading
- Tap "SEND"
- Check phone receives data
```

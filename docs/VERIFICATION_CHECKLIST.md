## 🔍 What to Check Next

### 1. Flutter Event Channel Reception

**Check if Flutter is receiving the data:**

```dart
// In your Flutter code (e.g., wear_dashboard.dart)
EventChannel('com.pulsify.watch/heartrate')
    .receiveBroadcastStream()
    .listen(
      (data) {
        print('📊 Flutter received HR data: $data');
        // Update UI with data['bpm'], data['ibiValues'], etc.
      },
      onError: (error) {
        print('❌ Event channel error: $error');
      },
    );
```

**Expected output in Flutter logs:**
```
📊 Flutter received HR data: {bpm: 78, ibiValues: [717], timestamp: 1732543571624, status: active}
```

**If you DON'T see this:**
- Check that `heartRateEventSink` is not null in MainActivity
- Verify the event channel name matches exactly
- Ensure Flutter is listening before Kotlin sends data

---

### 2. Watch-to-Phone Sync Test

**Test sending data to phone:**

```dart
// In Flutter (on watch)
final result = await platform.invokeMethod('sendBatchToPhone');
print('Batch send result: $result');
```

**Expected Kotlin logs:**
```
WatchToPhoneSync: Sending batch data to phone
WatchToPhoneSync: Found 1 connected nodes
WatchToPhoneSync: Sending batch to node: [node_id]
WatchToPhoneSync: Batch sent successfully
```

**If you DON'T see this:**
- Check Bluetooth connection between watch and phone
- Verify phone has Pulsify app installed
- Check message path consistency (see below)

---

### 3. Phone Data Listener Service

**Verify phone is receiving messages:**

**On Phone - Check logs:**
```
adb -s [phone_device_id] logcat | grep PhoneDataListener
```

**Expected output:**
```
PhoneDataListenerService: onMessageReceived(): [JSON data]
PhoneDataListenerService: Received heart rate batch: [data]
```

**If you DON'T see this:**
- Check `PhoneDataListenerService` is registered in AndroidManifest.xml
- Verify message path matches between watch and phone
- Ensure service is exported (`android:exported="true"`)

---

### 4. Message Path Consistency

**CRITICAL: Paths must match exactly!**

**Watch (WatchToPhoneSyncManager.kt):**
```kotlin
private const val MESSAGE_PATH = "/heart_rate"
private const val BATCH_PATH = "/heart_rate_batch"
```

**Phone (PhoneDataListenerService.kt):**
```kotlin
override fun onMessageReceived(messageEvent: MessageEvent) {
    when (messageEvent.path) {
        "/heart_rate" -> { /* Handle single */ }
        "/heart_rate_batch" -> { /* Handle batch */ }
    }
}
```

**Phone (AndroidManifest.xml):**
```xml
<service android:name=".PhoneDataListenerService" android:exported="true">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.google.android.gms.wearable.MESSAGE_RECEIVED" />
        <data
            android:host="*"
            android:pathPrefix="/heart_rate"
            android:scheme="wear" />
    </intent-filter>
</service>
```

## 🧪 Quick Test Commands

### Test 1: Check Permissions
```bash
adb shell dumpsys package com.pulsify.app | grep permission
```

**Expected:**
```
android.permission.BODY_SENSORS: granted=true
```

### Test 2: Check Service Connection
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "HealthTrackingConnector|onConnectionSuccess"
```

**Expected:**
```
HealthTrackingConnector: Tracker Service Connected
HealthTrac...Connection: onConnectionSuccess()
```

### Test 3: Check Heart Rate Data
```bash
adb logcat | grep -E "valid HR|MainViewModel.*HR:"
```

**Expected:**
```
TrackingRepositoryImpl: valid HR: 78
MainViewModel: HR: 78, IBI: [717], HRV: 0.0, SPO2: 0
```

### Test 4: Check Watch-to-Phone Sync
```bash
# On watch
adb -s [watch_device] logcat | grep WatchToPhoneSync

# On phone
adb -s [phone_device] logcat | grep PhoneDataListener
```

---

## 🎯 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue 1: No Heart Rate Data in Flutter

**Symptoms:**
- Kotlin logs show `valid HR: 78`
- Flutter UI shows no data

**Solution:**
```dart
// Ensure event channel is set up BEFORE starting tracking
final eventChannel = EventChannel('com.pulsify.watch/heartrate');
eventChannel.receiveBroadcastStream().listen((data) {
  setState(() {
    heartRate = data['bpm'];
    ibiValues = List<int>.from(data['ibiValues']);
  });
});

// THEN start tracking
await platform.invokeMethod('startHeartRate');
```

---

### Issue 2: Phone Not Receiving Data

**Symptoms:**
- Watch logs show "Batch sent successfully"
- Phone logs show nothing

**Solution:**
1. Check Bluetooth connection:
```bash
adb shell dumpsys bluetooth_manager | grep "Connected devices"
```

2. Verify phone app is installed:
```bash
adb -s [phone_device] shell pm list packages | grep Pulsify
```

3. Check message path in phone's AndroidManifest.xml matches watch's `MESSAGE_PATH`

---

### Issue 3: "No connected nodes found"

**Symptoms:**
```
WatchToPhoneSync: No connected nodes found
```

**Solution:**
1. Ensure watch and phone are paired via Bluetooth
2. Install Pulsify on phone
3. Add capability declaration to phone's `res/values/wear.xml`:

```xml
<resources>
    <string-array name="android_wear_capabilities">
        <item>pulsify_phone_app</item>
    </string-array>
</resources>
```

4. Verify capability name matches in `WatchToPhoneSyncManager.kt`:
```kotlin
private const val CAPABILITY_NAME = "pulsify_phone_app"
```

## ✅ Success Criteria

Your implementation is **FULLY WORKING** if you see:

### On Watch:
- [x] Permission granted
- [x] Health service connected
- [x] Heart rate data received (78-80 bpm)
- [x] IBI values collected
- [x] Flutter UI shows heart rate

### On Phone:
- [ ] Phone receives batch data
- [ ] PhoneDataListenerService logs message
- [ ] Flutter UI on phone shows received data

## 📞 Quick Debug Commands

```bash
# Watch logs (heart rate tracking)
adb -s [watch_device] logcat -s MainActivity HealthTrackingManager TrackingRepositoryImpl MainViewModel

# Watch logs (sync)
adb -s [watch_device] logcat -s WatchToPhoneSync

# Phone logs (data reception)
adb -s [phone_device] logcat -s PhoneDataListenerService

# Combined (both devices)
adb -s [watch_device] logcat | grep -E "HR:|IBI:" &
adb -s [phone_device] logcat | grep PhoneDataListener
```
